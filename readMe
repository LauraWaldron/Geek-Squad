This project will encompass a simple maze game that will allow the user to progress through 2 - 3 levels.
The game is essentially a 2D program that is composed of a 5x5 grid with a starting point (user begin position)
and an end point (the goal position). The goal of the game is for the user to move up, down, left, or right to
reach the goal position which will be indicated by a flag. This online application can be accessed or used by anyone 
with a link to the webpage. The purpose of this program is merely for entertainment so anyone of any caliber can
