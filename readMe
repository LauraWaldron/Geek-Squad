This project will encompass a simple maze game that will allow the user to progress through 2 - 3 levels.
The game is essentially a 2D program that is composed of a 5x5 grid with a starting point (user begin position)
and an end point (the goal position). The goal of the game is for the user to move up, down, left, or right to
reach the goal position which will be indicated by a flag. This online application can be accessed or used by anyone 
with a link to the webpage. The purpose of this program is merely for entertainment so anyone of any caliber can
play the game.

We picked our three characters for the game--a panda, a tiger, and a sloth. Jamie drew the characters for us. Our theme for the game
was also decided; a forest theme with green and brown. We figured out the controls for our game. On mobile devices we will use screen
controls and on a laptop, computer, or Macbook the user will use the arrow keys to get around or WASD.
